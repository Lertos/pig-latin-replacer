# Learned:
- How to use the Scanner object
- How to iterate through Strings
- How to use regular expressions to produce more efficient code (in both physical space and time complexity)
- Minor error checking and validation
- Iterating over an array
- Using a StringBuilder inside of a for loop to minimize performance (since every iteration a "+" on Strings are decompiled into creating StringBuilders)
- Creating a class with private methods; encapsulation
